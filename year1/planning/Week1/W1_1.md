# 📅 Monday – Systems Programming (C Language)

**🎯 Goal:** Reacquaint with C syntax and begin first project foundations.

---

## ⏱️ 2-Hour Tactical Execution Plan

| Time  | Task |
|-------|------|
| 30 min | Read **K&R C – Chapters 1 & 2** (type and run code examples) |
| 30 min | Write `hello_world.c` and a basic skeleton for a CLI calculator |
| 30 min | Install and verify tools: `gcc`, `gdb`, `valgrind`, `make` |
| 30 min | Create project structure in `~/quant-core/projects/` and write a Makefile |

---

## 📁 Project Setup

**Directory Structure:**
```
~/quant-core/
  └── projects/
        ├── cli-calculator/
        └── mycp/
  └── notes/
  └── books/
  └── logs/
```

**Minimal Makefile Example:**
```make
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -g

all: cli-calculator

cli-calculator: cli-calculator.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o cli-calculator cli-calculator.c

clean:
	rm -f cli-calculator
```
