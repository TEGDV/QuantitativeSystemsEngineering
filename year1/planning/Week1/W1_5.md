## 🎲 Mini Project Snippet

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int heads = 0, tails = 0;
    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        if (rand() % 2 == 0) heads++;
        else tails++;
    }
    printf("Heads: %d\nTails: %d\n", heads, tails);
    return 0;
