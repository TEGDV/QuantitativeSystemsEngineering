# 📅 W1_3 – Wednesday – Mathematics (Linear Algebra)

**🎯 Goal:** Refresher on vector operations and solving linear systems.

---

## ⏱️ 2-Hour Tactical Execution Plan

| Time  | Task |
|-------|------|
| 30 min | Watch **MIT 18.06 – Lecture 1**: The Geometry of Linear Equations |
| 30 min | Read **Strang – Section 1.1**: Vectors and Linear Combinations |
| 40 min | Solve a 3×3 system of equations: by hand and using Python (NumPy) |
| 20 min | Write a 3-bullet summary and log doubts for review |

---

## 🔢 Tools

**Python example:**
```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[2, 1, -1],
              [-3, -1, 2],
              [-2, 1, 2]])
b = np.array([8, -11, -3])
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
print(x)
```

Optional: Use **Desmos** or **Manim** to visualize vector addition in 2D.
