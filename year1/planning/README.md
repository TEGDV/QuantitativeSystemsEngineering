## CS:APP - Assault Protocol

This book is the doctrinal backbone for Year 1 systems knowledge. It will be approached methodically, one chapter per month, to ensure deep mastery over superficial understanding.

### **Preliminary Mission: Chapter 1 - Reconnaissance**

Chapter 1, "A Tour of Computer Systems," is a high-level operational overview. **Read it once, quickly, for context.** Do not get bogged down in details. Its purpose is to give you a map of the territory you will explore in depth in the following chapters. You have already covered it in Week 1. Refer back to it only if you need to recall how the pieces fit together.

### **Month 1: Chapter 2 - Representing Information**

This is the true starting point. The objective is to master how data exists at the bit level. The chapter is divided into a four-week assault.

* **Week 1: Foundations of Representation**
    * **Monday:** Read pp. 29-41 (Section 2.1.1 to 2.1.4).
        * **Focus:** Hexadecimal notation, `word size`, and byte ordering (endianness).
    * **Wednesday:** Read pp. 46-56 (Section 2.1.5 to 2.1.10).
        * **Focus:** String representation, bit-level operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`), and shift operations (`<<`, `>>`).

* **Week 2: Integer Representation**
    * **Monday:** Read pp. 56-69 (Section 2.2 to 2.2.4).
        * **Focus:** Unsigned integers and the logic of two's complement for signed integers.
    * **Wednesday:** Read pp. 69-79 (Section 2.2.5 to 2.2.8).
        * **Focus:** Conversions between signed/unsigned, sign extension, and the dangers of truncation.

* **Week 3: Integer Arithmetic**
    * **Monday:** Read pp. 79-88 (Section 2.3 to 2.3.3).
        * **Focus:** Two's complement addition, subtraction, and negation; overflow detection.
    * **Wednesday:** Read pp. 88-99 (Section 2.3.4 to 2.3.8).
        * **Focus:** Multiplication and the optimization of division by powers of two via shifts.

* **Week 4: Floating-Point Arithmetic**
    * **Monday:** Read pp. 99-110 (Section 2.4 to 2.4.3).
        * **Focus:** Fractional binary representation and the IEEE 754 standard (sign, exponent, fraction).
    * **Wednesday:** Read pp. 110-118 (Section 2.4.4 to 2.5).
        * **Focus:** Rounding modes, floating-point operations, and the nature of precision errors.
