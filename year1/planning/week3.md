# Week 3: Protocol - Logic in Silicon and Solving for X

The focus shifts from representation to execution. This week, you will learn how simple arithmetic and control flow translate into machine code. In parallel, you will learn the complete algorithm for solving any system of linear equations, the computational core of countless scientific problems. The work gets harder. Your focus must get sharper.

### **Monday: Computer Science - Machine-Level Arithmetic**
* **Objective:** Understand how arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, shifts) are performed in x86-64 assembly.
* **Block (2-4 Hours):** Read CS:APP, Chapter 3, Section 3.5 ("Arithmetic and Logical Operations").
* **Execution:**
    1.  Write simple C functions that perform various arithmetic operations (e.g., `long t = x*y + z;`).
    2.  Compile them with `gcc -S` and examine the assembly output.
    3.  Map each C operation to the corresponding assembly instructions (`leaq`, `addq`, `imulq`, etc.).
    4.  Pay special attention to the `leaq` instruction. Write a paragraph explaining why it's often used for arithmetic, not just for calculating addresses.

### **Tuesday: Mathematics - Solving Ax = b**
* **Objective:** Master the complete algorithm for solving systems of linear equations, including cases with no solution or infinite solutions.
* **Block (2-3 Hours):** Watch MIT 18.06, Lecture 7 ("Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions") and Lecture 8 ("Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R").
* **Execution:**
    1.  Take a 3x4 matrix `A` and find the complete solution to `Ax = 0`. This involves finding the pivot and free variables and constructing the special solutions.
    2.  Take the same matrix `A` and a vector `b`, and find the complete solution to `Ax = b`.
    3.  Explain the relationship between the particular solution and the special solutions from the nullspace.

### **Wednesday: Computer Science - Control Flow**
* **Objective:** Understand how control structures like `if/else`, `for`, and `while` are implemented using conditional codes and jumps in assembly.
* **Block (2-4 Hours):** Read CS:APP, Chapter 3, Section 3.6 ("Control").
* **Execution:**
    1.  Memorize the purpose of the condition codes (CF, ZF, SF, OF).
    2.  Write simple C functions using `if/else`, `do-while`, and `for` loops.
    3.  Compile with `gcc -S` and analyze the assembly. Identify the `cmp` and `test` instructions, and the corresponding jump instructions (`je`, `jne`, `jg`, etc.).
    4.  Draw a flowchart for a `for` loop and label it with the assembly instructions generated by the compiler.

### **Thursday: Mathematics - Reinforcement: Rank and Dimension**
* **Objective:** Solidify your understanding of linear independence, spanning, basis, and dimensionâ€”the core concepts describing the "size" of a vector space.
* **Block (2-3 Hours):** Watch MIT 18.06, Lecture 9 ("Linear Independence, Basis, and Dimension"). Dedicate the session to solving problems from the associated problem set.
* **Execution:**
    1.  Given a set of vectors, determine if they are linearly independent.
    2.  Find a basis for the column space and nullspace of a given matrix.
    3.  State the dimensions of the four fundamental subspaces (column space, nullspace, row space, left nullspace) for a given `m x n` matrix of rank `r`.

### **Friday: The Forge - Structuring Data**
* **Objective:** Learn how to create complex data types using structs in Rust. This is the foundation for building any non-trivial application.
* **Block (2-3 Hours):** Read and work through Chapter 5 of *The Rust Programming Language* ("Using Structs to Structure Related Data").
* **Execution:**
    1.  Define a `User` struct with fields like `username`, `email`, and `sign_in_count`.
    2.  Write functions that take an instance of the `User` struct as an argument.
    3.  Implement methods on the `User` struct using an `impl` block. Create a method that returns the user's information as a formatted string.
    4.  Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle, first using separate variables, and then refactoring it to use a `Rectangle` struct.

### **Saturday: The Forge - Structs in Action**
* **Objective:** Apply your knowledge of structs to a practical problem and explore more advanced features like tuple structs and debug printing.
* **Block (3-4 Hours):** Continue practicing concepts from Chapter 5 of the Rust book.
* **Execution:**
    1.  Refactor your rectangle program to use methods on the `Rectangle` struct, such as `area()` and `can_hold()`.
    2.  Add the `#[derive(Debug)]` annotation to your structs and experiment with printing them using the `{:?}` and `{:#?}` format specifiers.
    3.  Create a simple tuple struct for a `Color` (e.g., `struct Color(i32, i32, i32);`) and use it.
    4.  Write a C program that uses a `struct` to represent a `User`. Compare the syntax and memory safety considerations with your Rust implementation.

### **Sunday: Review and Reload**
* **Objective:** Consolidate the week's knowledge, identify areas of weakness, and prepare the next week's operational plan.
* **Block (2 Hours):**
* **Execution:**
    1.  Review all notes. Focus on the mapping of C control flow to assembly jumps and the process of finding the complete solution to `Ax = b`.
    2.  Update your "Weak Points" list.
    3.  Create the `week_04.md` file. The first task is to address your weak points.
    4.  Outline the new topics for Week 4: CS:APP Ch. 3 (Procedures/Stack), Math (The Four Subspaces).
