# Year 1 – Core Foundations

This year focuses on rebuilding and solidifying fundamental knowledge in mathematics, systems-level programming, and the basics of market microstructure. The objective is to establish technical fluency in C programming, linear algebra, probability theory, and low-level systems concepts essential for high-performance financial systems.

---

## Objectives

- Relearn and deepen core mathematical concepts: linear algebra, probability, and discrete math
- Develop fluency in C programming and memory-safe, low-level development
- Gain working knowledge of Linux internals and process control
- Understand the foundations of financial markets, exchanges, and order execution
- Build small-scale, systems-oriented projects to solidify technical concepts

---

## Structure

### 1. Notes

All theoretical and practical content covered throughout the year, including:

- `notes/math/` – linear algebra, probability, discrete structures
- `notes/systems/` – C syntax, system calls, memory models, I/O
- `notes/finance/` – trading basics, market microstructure

### 2. Projects

Hands-on development tasks focused on reinforcing theoretical knowledge:

- CLI calculator (C)
- Memory visualizer (linked list + heap tracking)
- Order book simulator (FIFO matching engine)
- File copy utility (`mycp`)
- Random number simulators (coin toss, dice, uniform distribution)

Each project includes a brief write-up, source code, build instructions, and test cases.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Year 1, the learner should be able to:

- Write and debug medium-complexity C programs
- Use system-level APIs for file I/O, process control, and memory
- Apply linear algebra and probability to small-scale simulations
- Describe the operation of basic trading venues and order books
- Create modular, tested code for small systems

- Projects are written in C using GNU build tools, tested on Linux
- LaTeX templates available in `../templates/` for final write-ups if needed
