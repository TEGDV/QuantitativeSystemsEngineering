# Year 5 – Full-Stack Trading Architecture, Strategy Deployment, and Expert-Level Integration

Year 5 is the capstone year of the Quantitative Systems Engineering program. It brings together all previous disciplines—mathematics, systems engineering, quantitative research, and finance—into fully integrated, performance-critical trading systems. The focus is on finalizing a complete research-to-execution pipeline, deploying complex strategies, and validating them in real-time or simulated environments under production constraints.

This year aims to close the gap between high-level strategy research and low-level system deployment.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a complete end-to-end trading infrastructure
- Integrate research tools, signal generation, execution logic, and risk management into a unified architecture
- Fine-tune latency at every stage (data ingestion, signal response, network transmission)
- Simulate co-location constraints, clock sync, and microstructure effects
- Conduct structured research and benchmarking to validate strategy performance and robustness
- Build a long-term portfolio of tested, modular strategies with real-world deployment considerations

## Structure

### 1. Notes

Expert-level research, architecture planning, and deployment notes:

- `notes/architecture/` – end-to-end system design, component orchestration, logging, health checks
- `notes/research/` – strategy development, signal decay, live-trading risk controls
- `notes/hardware/` – NIC tuning, core pinning, prefetching, branch prediction, CPU isolation
- `notes/infra/` – co-location simulation, time sync (PTP), high-availability trading systems

### 2. Projects

Production-grade trading system components:

- Full-stack paper trading engine with modular components:
  - Market data adapters
  - Signal plugin interface
  - Risk engine
  - Execution engine
  - Reporting dashboard
- Realistic exchange simulator with latency injection, order queueing, microstructure noise
- Strategy repository with versioned configs and evaluation scripts
- Latency benchmark framework: timestamp every stage (ingestion → execution) with `rdtsc`
- Deployment scripts for running full system on bare-metal or containerized environments

## Key Resources

- **Systems & Performance**
  - *Designing for Low-Latency – Herb Sutter talks, Facebook and HFT engineering blogs*
  - *FPGA/Hardware acceleration references (optional exploration)*
  - *Linux Performance Tools – Brendan Gregg*

- **Architecture**
  - *The Datacenter as a Computer – Barroso, Holzle*
  - *High Availability and Disaster Recovery design (finance-specific)*

- **Finance & Strategy**
  - *Advanced Algorithmic Trading Models – research papers (SIG, Jump, HRT)*
  - *Strategy Backtesting and Validation – Marcos López de Prado*
  - *QuantStart, QuantConnect strategy research archives*

- **Deployment**
  - *Real-time system logging, alerting, and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)*
  - *Systemd socket activation, process supervision, watchdogs*

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Year 5, the learner should be able to:

- Architect and implement a full-scale trading system from scratch
- Analyze and optimize each stage of the system for latency, reliability, and throughput
- Deploy live-testing infrastructure with realistic simulation and safety constraints
- Evaluate strategies under realistic assumptions using version-controlled experiments
- Operate with the level of rigor and performance expected at elite HFT firms

---

## Final Capstone

The Year 5 capstone is the deployment of a complete paper-trading system with real-time data ingestion, live strategy execution, risk control, and performance tracking.

Deliverables:

- `src/`: all core components (C++, Rust)
- `config/`: strategy and system configuration files
- `data/`: historical and simulated market data
- `eval/`: strategy evaluation notebooks, performance plots
- `docs/`: system architecture diagrams, latency profiles, operational docs

---

## Notes

- This year simulates a production engineering and quant workflow
- Version control, test coverage, performance profiling, and documentation are enforced as if this were a real HFT codebase
- The final system is ready to be adapted for deployment in co-location environments, research clusters, or hybrid simulation stacks
