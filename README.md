# QuantitativeSystemsEngineering

A self-directed, five-year learning project to master the intersection of mathematics, systems programming, and quantitative finance—designed to meet the standards of elite low-latency trading and HFT roles.

This repository documents my structured curriculum, personal notes, code, projects, and research efforts under a custom major I call **Quantitative Systems Engineering**.

---

## Objectives

- Build deep expertise in:
  - Advanced mathematics (linear algebra, probability, stochastic processes, optimization)
  - Systems-level programming (C, C++, Rust, Linux internals, networking)
  - Market microstructure and quantitative trading systems
- Develop production-grade trading infrastructure and research tools
- Create a public portfolio showcasing technical capability, domain knowledge, and long-term discipline

## Structure

The curriculum is divided into five years, with ~20 hours/week invested. Each year includes theoretical study, systems development, financial research, and applied projects.

## Core Topics

* **Mathematics**

  * Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, Probability, Stochastic Processes
  * Optimization, Numerical Methods, Spectral Analysis

* **Programming & Systems**

  * C, C++, Rust, Assembly (x86-64), Compiler internals
  * OS concepts, Linux perf tooling, lock-free data structures
  * Low-level networking, kernel bypass, latency tuning

* **Finance & Trading**

  * Market microstructure, order books, execution models
  * Quantitative research, stat arb, signal engineering

## Milestones

Each year ends with a capstone:

* Year 1: Matching engine simulator + replay tool (C)
* Year 2: FIX protocol implementation + backtest framework
* Year 3: Real-time market data feed handler (C++/Rust)
* Year 4: Signal generation + risk engine with nanosecond profiling
* Year 5: Full-stack paper trading system with strategy plugins

## Philosophy

This project is built on the belief that rigor, precision, and long-term focus can substitute for formal academic degrees. The structure, consistency, and deliverables are modeled after world-class standards in quantitative research and systems engineering.
